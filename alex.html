      <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
      <p class="byline">by J. K. Rowling</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <p>Harry Potter is the main character and discovers he's a wizard and goes to Hogwarts. A good kid, he's brave and there for his friends. Such as when Harry first encounters Ron on the train in Chapter 6 (The at Platform Nine and Three Quarters), you see how courteous he is, offering snacks. As the book goes on, Harry toughens up, learns about his parents, and truly becomes a hero. 
          What he does essentially propels the entire story. He's got issues he's struggling with on the inside and outside. Outside, he's battling Voldemort, who's intent on killing him and taking over everything. Inside, Harry's afraid, feels isolated, and has the burden of being the chosen one. 
          Chapter 12 (The Mirror of Erised) is emotional – seeing his parents makes you understand how much he desires a family. Despite being scared, he's brave and shows he's a good person. The climactic showdown is Harry vs. Voldemort in Chapter 17 (The Man with Two Faces). Harry confronts Voldemort (in the guise of Professor Quirrell) and is willing to die to protect the Philosopher's Stone and his friends. That demonstrates how courageous he is and how love saves him. Voldemort is not able to harm Harry because his mom had given her life, proving that love conquers evil. It's the most action-packed section, where good overcomes evil. All the action's at Hogwarts, a mystical, full of secrets castle. Where it happens matters, because it makes Harry who he becomes. As in Chapter 8 (The Potions Master), the classroom atmosphere is magical and sort of creepy, particularly with Snape. Hogwarts is not only a school – it's Harry's home and where he is supposed to be. The combination of fun and risk indicates that Harry is maturing. The main idea of the book is that love and friendship are strong. The book illustrates love conquers hate and kindness is real strength. In Chapter 16 (Through the Trapdoor), Harry, Ron, and Hermione put their lives on the line, demonstrating how friendship and teamwork conquer fear. Standing up and doing what is right even when it's difficult is another message. What the story teaches us is that being kind, loyal, and loving is how you defeat evil.
          Throughout the story, Harry’s growth shows how experiences shape a person’s character. Every challenge he faces—whether it’s a troll in the girls’ bathroom, a Quidditch match, or facing Voldemort teaches him about bravery, loyalty, and the value of sacrifice. He starts as a lonely boy but ends the book surrounded by true friends and a sense of belonging. Even though he returns to the Dursleys at the end, he carries the lessons of love and courage from Hogwarts with him. The story reminds readers that real strength isn’t about power or fame, but about compassion and doing what’s right even when it’s frightening. Rowling uses magic as a way to show very human emotions fear, hope, love, and loss. That’s what makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone timeless: it’s a magical adventure with a heart full of humanity.</p>
