      <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
      <p class="byline">by Suzanne Collins</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <p>Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games clearly reflects a Marxist view of society by showing how wealth, power, and class division shape the lives of people in Panem. The novel centers on Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 who must fight to survive in a deadly competition designed by the rich Capitol. Through Katniss’s experiences, Collins exposes how the ruling class maintains control by using poverty, fear, and entertainment to keep the poor obedient. The relationship between characters and their society shows an unfair structure where the few enjoy luxury while the many suffer from hunger and labor.

Most of the themes in the book relate to social issues such as class, and economic inequality, with the Capitol taking on the role of the aristocracy, and the districts (especially District 12) of the working class, who may have to mine coal to survive, with Katniss noting on page 6 that the District 12 area is such a poor place to be that she thinks, "You can starve to death in safety". In the opening ceremony, Katniss and Peeta are covered in flames in order to give entertainment to the Capitol citizens, who are turning the workers' suffering into a spectacle. Thus, even the rich see the poor as merely objects of amusement, just as the upper social stratum in most societies ties its comfort to the labor and sufferings of the lower stratum. Economic exploitation is also seen in how the Capitol controls all resources. Districts cannot trade freely or keep what they produce; everything is owned by the Capitol. On page 52, Gale tells Katniss, “It’s the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy.” This reflects how economic control becomes a weapon of oppression. People in the districts work hard but remain poor because the system ensures their labor benefits only the Capitol. Even the Hunger Games themselves are a symbol of exploitation. Children from poor families must risk their lives to entertain the rich and maintain their power. The choices the characters make are defined by economic circumstances. If the totalitarian government chose Katniss instead of Prim, Katniss would not volunteer for the Games. The book shows through Katniss's pre-Game life how poverty drives people to break the law. She hunts in the woods for food to feed her family, breaking the law and risking capital punishment (page 5), during the time the Capitol folks are enjoying themselves every day, doing anything they want to do. The differences in lifestyles are similar to capitalist societies, where a small percentage controls the economy while the working poor are pitted against each other to compete for survival. Katniss and Peeta's love story is a propaganda tool of the Capitol, though it is presented in-game as a tale of romance.

The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins shows social class divides. It also shows capitalism dehumanizes and degrades people within. By criticizing with a Marxist lens, the reader learns that Panem does not just exist as a dystopian novel, but reflects the same unequal and exploitation in our own world. The book argues that if this one group holds the keys to the kingdom, equity and justice will never exist for anyone. Collins says people need to see the systems of oppression that keep people isolated and mobilize for change.</p>
