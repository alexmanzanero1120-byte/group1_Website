      <h2>Tuesday with Morrie</h2>
      <p class="byline">by Mitch Albom</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <p>The story “Tuesdays with Morrie” by Mitch Albom is about life, love, and learning what really matters more than money or fame. From a Marxist or sociological view, it shows how people are affected by society, money, and the need to be successful. It teaches that true happiness is not found in being rich but in love, care, and simple living.

In the story, the relationship between Morrie and Mitch shows how people live differently in society. Mitch lives in a world where success means having money, a good job, and a big name. He works very hard and forgets to enjoy life. Morrie, his old teacher, is the opposite. Even though he is sick, he stays happy because he values love, family, and friendship more than money. Their relationship shows the difference between someone controlled by society and someone who chooses to live freely and meaningfully.

The story also shows problems in society, like how people judge others based on money or job. Many people think that being rich means being successful. Mitch is one of them at first  he works all the time just to earn more. But Morrie teaches him that real success comes from the heart, not from money. He tells Mitch that love, kindness, and time with others are more important than anything you can buy. This shows how society can make people forget the true meaning of life.

Even though the story does not show direct unfair treatment about money, it still shows how people can be trapped by work and pressure. Mitch feels that he must always work hard, even when it makes him tired and sad. This shows how people are pushed by society to keep chasing success. Morrie helps him see that life is not only about money and work. He teaches Mitch that it’s okay to slow down, spend time with loved ones, and enjoy every moment.

Money also affects the choices of the characters. Mitch’s decisions are mostly about earning and being secure. He believes that having money means being safe. But when he spends time with Morrie, he realizes that true safety and peace come from love, not money. Morrie lives a simple life, but he is happy because he knows how to value people and feelings. Their difference shows how money and society can shape the way people think and live.

At the end of the story, “Tuesdays with Morrie” teaches that being rich does not mean being happy. Real success is not about how much money you have but how much love and care you share with others. Morrie becomes a good example of living a meaningful life. He refuses to be controlled by money or the world’s rules. Instead, he chooses to live with love and peace. The story reminds everyone that money fades, but love, kindness, and memories stay forever.</p>
